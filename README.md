PHP-Boilerplate
===============
This is a boilerplate for starting a small site or app with `PHP`, it was created because every time I needed to create a small something I ended up wishing it was set up to expand into something bigger i.e. now I need to set up GRUNT, or I need to connect to a db so now lets code that out...

###Proposed Ideas to implement:

- db integration
- easy navigation set up
- head and foot set up dynamically
- page configurations set in array for easy SEO to whole site
- GRUNT workflow built in with 
    - concat *(concatinate all JS)*
    - uglify *(minimize all JS)*
    - imagemin *(minimizes images)*
    - SASS *(parse sass)*
    - autoprefixer *(add vendor prefixes to css)*
    - GRUNT will also watch for changes as well
- Each page has the ability to have custom css or JS
- Favicons set up for multiple devices


###This is a work in progress
If you plan to clone and play with please keep in mind that it is a work in progress, so any issues please let me know or fix it yourself and submit a pull.

###Status so far
Most of the main segments are built as of now. I think the next step for me is to use it to build a small site and see where the holes are cause I'm sure there are a lot of them.

###instructions on use
This section will be written once I conduct my initial test of building a small site with the boilerplate.
